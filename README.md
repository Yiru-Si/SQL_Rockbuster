Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project - help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. 

## Background and Objective
Ruckbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, Rockbuster Stealth is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. To help with the launch strategy for the new online video service, I used SQL to analyze the data and answer business questions that other departments may have.

## Key Questions
* Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
* What was the average rental duration for all videos?
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
* Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data
Rockbuster data set: data for this project is fabricated and provided by Career Foundry.  
Query-based analysis is conducted using PostgreSQL.

## Deliverables
* A presentation of the launch strategy
* A Data Dictionary for the project
* Visualizations created with Tableau. Find them here: [Presenting SQL Results](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yiru.si/viz/Data_Immersion_3_10/Movie_Most_Revenue)
